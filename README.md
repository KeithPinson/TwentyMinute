# Twenty Minute

The Twenty Minute Solution, as I once called an earlier version of this app, was inspired by my practice of racing the clock to help keep my mind from wandering. This evolved into tallying 20 minute races of "uninterrupted" work in a day. In this iteration I am keeping the simple design of the old "Solution" version but will be incorporating my _pools_ and _strings_ style of to do lists.

## version 0.1

This is a work-in-progress, wait until version 1.0 to actually use the app.

## Timers

By the way this is not a Pomodoro Timer. Although both Twenty Minute and the Pomodoro Technique are inspired by kitchen timers they have different goals. The Pomodoro seems to have been invented for someone who could work uninterrupted for hours forgetting to take a break -- is that really a problem? _Twenty Minute_ is for those of us that find our day continually interrupted by things unplanned.

## To Do Lists

_Pools_ and _Strings_ style of to do lists will be added to the app -- more on this later.
