Structure â‰  Design
------------------

We divide the source code into folders favored by discipline,
ie. designers and coders of:

 - Business logic
 - Data source
 - user experience
 - user interface

This division may be misleading.

Dividing the architecture in this way make projects easier
to manage but can obscure the features of the software itself.
Within each folder is typically a file with a piece of the
feature or function.

Like a cake, our business logic, user-interface, etc. form
the layers but the slice of a single feature is what care
about when the software is all done and baked.

---

1. Practice "separation of concerns". Keep the Tests and
Design clean with separate files for each feature.

2. Use the same keyword(s) in the file names to identify the
design feature or function across folders.
